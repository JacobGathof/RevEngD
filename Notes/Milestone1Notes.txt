These are the notes for the Milestone one checkoff:


Design is good most people did filters. 
String points to object so that's right.
Lab1-1 It doesn't do dependencies so we added all of the base classes and ran it recursively, that's fine.
JComponent -r That's good.
Our thing with private args are good. all pointing to object, looks funny.
