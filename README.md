### About the project
This application can analyze a Java project and generate and display the UML diagram representing the class structure. 
The project currently features 4 command line arguments: 

1. [-r] - Parse the project recursively
2. [-pu] - Only include public fields, methods, and classes
3. [-po] - Include public and protected fields, methods, and classes
4. [-pr] - Include fields, methods, and classes of any visibility


## Team Contribution
The project is configured to use Log4J, which you can also use for your own classes. See [SceneBuilder API](/src/main/java/csse374/revengd/soot/SceneBuilder.java) for an example.
